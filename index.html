      <p>Since 2003, I have been working in research projects related with Bioengineering. My research interests have been oriented in the application of Supervised/Non-supervised Machine learning techniques in the development of computer based tools to analyze biomedical data like cardiac medical images and physiological signals.  An example of some contributions are:</p>

<p>is the final work of my  Computer Science Engineer degree that was related to the development of a Transmission and Remote Monitoring System of physiological parameters like ECG signals, oximetry and arterial presion. </p>

<p>The final work of my master degree was related to image processing and computer vision, specifically in left ventricle motion analysis covering  two different modalities like Computed Tomography and Angiography. </p>

<p>My PhD thesis in Signal processing and telecommunications was developed in the Laboratory of signal and image processing (Laboratoire de Traitement du Signal et de l'Image), LTSI, which is a research laboratory attached to the Inserm, a leading biomedical and public health research institution in France. </p>

<p>In my PhD, I have worked in the classification of normal/abnormal wall motion in Left Ventricle (LV) function in cardiac cine MRI with the assessment of Speckle Tracking Echocardiography and in the detection of cardiac Fibrosis in Late Gadolinium Enhancement MRI. </p>

<p>I have applied supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for solving the addressed problems, i.e, clustering, Support Vector Machines, Sparse signal representation and Dictionary learning-based approaches.  I proposed a novel feature extraction procedure for the discrimination of cardiac motion abnormalities  consisting in spatio-temporal features and their representation in other domains like Fourier, Wavelets, Curvelets. </p>

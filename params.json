{"name":"Programming-skills","tagline":"Source code showcasing programming skills from Juan MANTILLA","body":"Since 2003, I have been working in research projects related with Bioengineering. My research interests have been oriented in the application of Supervised/Non-supervised Machine learning techniques in the development of computer based tools to analyze biomedical data like cardiac medical images and physiological signals.  As a Computer Science MSc/Engineer with academic teaching experience, I have strong programming skills in different languages and platforms tools, i.e. C/C++, JAVA, Matlab, ITK, VTK, FLTK, OpenCV, R. And also background in Software engineer.  An example of some contributions are:\r\n\r\n### Transmission and Remote Monitoring System of physiological parameters\r\n\r\nis the final work of my  Computer Science Engineer degree that was related to the development of a Transmission and Remote Monitoring System of physiological parameters like ECG signals, oximetry and arterial presion. \r\n\r\n ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7881274/11715649/c5966b64-9f43-11e5-8d31-a52f6a151eb3.png)\r\n\r\n### A 3-D Multi-Modality Image Framework for Left Ventricle Motion Analysis\r\n\r\nThe final work of my master degree was related to image processing and computer vision, specifically in left ventricle motion analysis covering  two different modalities like Computed Tomography and Angiography. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7881274/11715735/8306646a-9f44-11e5-8f1e-40f0b1f5b652.png)\r\n\r\n### Heart diseases characterization in Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Sparse representation and Dictionary Learning approaches\r\n\r\nMy PhD thesis in Signal processing and telecommunications was developed in the Laboratory of signal and image processing (Laboratoire de Traitement du Signal et de l'Image), LTSI, which is a research laboratory attached to the Inserm, a leading biomedical and public health research institution in France. \r\n\r\nIn my PhD, I have worked in the classification of normal/abnormal wall motion in Left Ventricle (LV) function in cardiac cine MRI with the assessment of Speckle Tracking Echocardiography and in the detection of cardiac Fibrosis in Late Gadolinium Enhancement MRI. \r\n\r\n#### For LV wall motion classification in cardiac cine MRI\r\n\r\nI have applied supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for solving the addressed problems, i.e, clustering, Support Vector Machines, Sparse signal representation and Dictionary learning-based approaches.  I proposed a novel feature extraction procedure for the discrimination of cardiac motion abnormalities  consisting in spatio-temporal features without the need of segmentation of the LV boundaries and their representation in other domains like Fourier, Wavelets, Curvelets. \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7881274/11715892/0f8f8348-9f46-11e5-89f7-89c200ee218e.png)\r\n\r\n#### For Fibrosis detection in LGE MRI\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7881274/11716267/d86a6402-9f48-11e5-87dc-a2459c43cd8d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
